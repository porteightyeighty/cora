/**
 * Type ::= Base | Arrow(Type, Type) | Data(Type,...,Type) | TVar(name).
 *
 * Here, there are two kinds of sorts:
 * - base types: represented by a single name
 * - data types: represented by a constructor (a name) and a non-empty list of arguments
 *
 * In first-order term rewriting, all types are Base.
 *
 * In simply-typed rewriting, all types are Base or Arrow.
 *
 * Typically, data types that take arguments are used in polymorphic settings that also consider
 * type variables.  However, this is not mandatory; data types can also be useful for instance to
 * represent product types.
 *
 * Writing Arrow as the right-associative operator →, we can write all types in a form
 * σ1 → ... → σm → τ, where all σi are Types and τ is a sort or type variable.  This will often
 * be used for inductive reasoning.
 *
 * Note: all instances of Type must (and can be expected to) be immutable.
